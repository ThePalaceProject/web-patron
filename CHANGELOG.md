## CHANGELOG

### UNRELEASED CHANGES

### 4.4.0

- Add: Allow Clever log-in issues to display properly on the site.
- Fix: Use `window.history.replaceState` to strip the url hash after login instead of Next.js's `router.replace`. This fixes a bug where render would fail after initial login.
- chore: Improve error tracking when app fails to fetch static props.

### 4.3.0

- Fix: Improve the appearance of home page book thumbnails for larger viewports
- tests: Add a Github Workflow to trigger integration tests in NYPL-Simplified/integration-tests-web.
- Fix: Serve the sw.js file from library-simplified-webpub-viewer in /public so that it can actually be used by the webpub viewer.

- Fix: Refactor See More card to use the same sizing and aspect ratio of the book cover images.
- Fix: Fix delay between when you reach the end of a lane and when the forward/back arrows turn gray (disabled).
- Add: Custom Open eBooks Login Picker page to show helpful documentation when choosing a login method.
- Fix: Don't download react-axe in production. Shaves 60% off the first load bundle.
- Add: Lazy-loading of book cover images: A book cover image source will now only download once at least one pixel of the image's placeholder becomes visible in the viewport.
- Refactor: Re-enabled Typescript's strict type checking to provide better runtime type safety guarantees, and keep type safety from deteriorating hrough development.
- Fix: Properly track AxisNow decryption errors to Bugsnag.

- Add: Landing page for Open Ebooks
- Fix: Fix our `APP_CONFIG` mocking in storybook so that `showMedium` and `companionApp` can be set via the toolbar once again.
- Refactor: Made the login state a full page so that it can be navigated to directly.

### 4.0.0

- Feature: Support auth-protected collections.
- Fix: Update webpub viewer.

### 3.1.3

- Fix: Update the production docker publish Github Action to v2, allowing for use of private Github package registry for AxisNow Decryptor.
- Fix: Book covers and titles in BookList now link to the book page

### v3.1.2

- Bump to v3.1.2 in order to tricker Github Actions run. No changes, but renamed branches to `dev` `qa` and `production` from `beta` and `master`.

### v3.1.1

- Fix: Update github workflow files to properly publish new branches (production, qa, dev).

### v3.1.0

- Add: Enforce changelog updates on PRs.
- Feature: Update list design.
- Feature: Add storybook to aid in developing and designing complicated states.
- Fix: Properly parse server errors into `ServerError` for use throughout the application to show the user better error messages.
- Fix: Deterministic `buildId` based on git commit SHA in order to allow running multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer.
- Fix: Fetch the config file synchronously at startup so that the bugsnag api key can be used during the webpack setup.
- Improvement: Application now tracks errors better by parsing them more precisely, and then recording them to bugsnag and console.

### v3.0.1

- hotfix: Checkout the master branch with submodules when building production docker container

### v3.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Config file is now a yml file and can configure media support and other env vars. See readme for more info.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `SHORTEN_URLS` env var. Url parameters will no longer be shortened. We will look for a server solution to pretty urls in the future.

- Feature: Add support for Clever auth providers.
- Feature: Add Webpub Viewer for AxisNow formats.

- Feature: Add support for tracking app events via Google Tag Manager.
- Fix: Update CleverAuth button to use AnchorButton for a11y and semantic reasons

- Fix: Environment variables can now be passed into the docker container, because the container is now building and running the app instead of just running it.
- Add: Remove books from local storage when a user logs out.
- Add: Optional error reporting via [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/).
- Refactor: Complete rewrite of the data layer, removing opds-web-client and adding [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching. Includes many UX improvments.

- Feature: Add support for SAML auth providers.
- Feature: Add confirmation modal to the sign out button.

- Fix: Don't show search bar if collection does not include search data.
- Fix: Fetch loans on page load when auth credentials are detected so that if you navigate directly to a book you have checked out, it will properly show checked out state.
- Fix: Make BookCover show a better image fallback on image load failure. Also show medium icon on load, and fade image in once it is done loading.
- Fix: Only fetch loans on app start, instead updating our internal store whenever we perform a successful mutation like borrowing a book.
- Fix: Sort My Books by loan date. Open Access content is displayed at the end (bottom).
- Fix: Prevent the current book from appearing in recommendations on book page

## 2.2.1

- Refactor: Rename `node` in tests to `utils`, as it is more accurate.
- Fix: Don't show download options for audiobooks since there is no way to play them on desktop. Only show SimplyE callout instead.

- Import and use the Card component from NYPL/design-system-react-components.
- Removed the grid view as it seemed redundant with the list view (for now).

- Refactor: Update build configuration and server code to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- Refactor: Replace react-router with file-system Next.js routing.
- Add: `.env` file support
- Fix: Correctly send 404s when using one library or multiple.

- Removed travis CI as it has been replaced by Github Actions

### 2.0.1

#### Added

- Created Github Actions workflows to test, release, and deploy docker images to Docker Hub for beta and master.

### 2.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

- Implement new designs provided by Amigos
- Replace css with `theme-ui`. Ignore the foreground and background color from the Circulation Manager. Theming functionality will be added back soon.
- Remove OAuth support. This will be added back soon along with SAML.
- Moved the docker files directly in to the repository root.

#### Internal changes

- Decoupled the app from `opds-web-client`. We now import select functionality but essentially render our own app instead of passing custom components in to the `opds-web-client` app.
- Refactored server code and added `webpack-dev-middleware` to enable hot reloading in development.
- Upgraded to stable React context API.
- Switched from Tslint to Eslint. (Tslint is deprecated)
- Upgraded to React Router v4.
- Installed Prettier to automatically format code uniformly before it reaches source control.
- Removed the second redux instance. We used to use a second redux instance for recommendations state and complaints state. Refactored out local redux to use react's `useReducer` and context instead.
- Turned on typescript's [strictNullChecks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#--strictnullchecks).
- Added `react-axe` for accessibility warnings in development.
- Created numerous hooks that allow re-use of various functionality like auth, linking, etc.
