# APP MEDIA SUPPORT
# Each entry has a setting of "show", "redirect" or "show-and-redirect".
#
# "redirect" tells the app to display a prompt directing the
# user to read the book in the companion mobile app (usually SimplyE).
#
# The default for unlisted entries is unsupported. The format will be
# completely hidden. Any OPDS Entry with only this one unsupported format
# will not be visible in the app.
