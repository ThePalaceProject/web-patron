/**
 * Explanation / Background of this features:
 *
 * The server gives us breadcrumbs showing where a user is when it sends us
 * a collection (aka an OPDS Feed). It does not give us these breadcrumbs when
 * it sends us a book (aka an OPDS Entry), because a book can be part of many
 * different collections, so the server doesn't know what to send.
 *
 * We would like the user to be able to see their breadcrumbs when they click in
 * to view a book from a collection. We can do this because the front end knows
 * where the user is coming from, we just have to save the breadcrumbs from the
 * last viewed collection and then use them when showing a book. This context
 * is for saving those breadcrumbs.
