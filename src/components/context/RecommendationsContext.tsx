/**
 * The recommendations state is somewhat confusing. It is no longer stored
 * in redux, since it proved easier to move it into react context instead
 * of trying to add it as a new reducer to the imported opds redux store.
 * However, it does import the same reducer code as an opds "collection",
 * and will dispatch actions from the opds ActionCreator, but with its own
 * dispatch method.
 *
 * In the future, we should look to unify this all into a single redux
 * implementation, possibly by having opds export its reducers and actions
 * and then letting consuming apps build their own store and add custom
 * reducers as necessary.
